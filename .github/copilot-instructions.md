## Adding a project page

When a user requests to add a project page:

- Add the page to the site based on the filled data, according to `how-to-add-project.md`
- SLIGHTLY edit the text for clarity, flow, and punctuation
- Use Markdown format. Try to avoid line breaks, separate paragraphs with blank lines
