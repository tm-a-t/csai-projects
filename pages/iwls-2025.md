The goal of&nbsp;this project is&nbsp;to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the 
[IWLS 2025 Programming Contest on&nbsp;Boolean Circuit Synthesis](https://www.iwls.org/iwls2025/). 
In&nbsp;this competition, the participants are given the truth tables of&nbsp;200 Boolean functions and the goal 
is&nbsp;to&nbsp;synthesize efficient circuits (over the $\{\land, \neg\}$ basis)
computing these functions. The smaller are the circuits, the higher is&nbsp;the rank.

## Report

During three months, we&nbsp;have been designing and implementing various heuristics for the circuit synthesis problem. Mostly, we&nbsp;have been
developing the following two areas.

1. Deciphering functions. Since it is hard to generate a circuit for an
   arbitrary function, knowing actual meaning of a function would help,
   so we invested a lot of resources into that area. We looked at
   different characteristics (number of zeros, injectivity), also drew
   a picture for each output, where we split the input into two parts,
   interpret each one as a number, and a pixel $(i,j)$ gets a color
   depending on an output when the first number is $i$ and the second
   one is $j$. For some functions we managed to see what they do, for
   some we got some insights and made a final circuit using `ABC`.

2. Circuit synthesis and simplification. As a&nbsp;baseline, we used the
   `ABC` tool. As was discovered this year, multiple calls of `ABC` may
   improve the circuit. Once the circuit was improved after more than
   4500 calls. `CIOPS` and `eSLIM` were also used, simplifying some
   circuits by 40%. For a few benchmarks, we used our new tool that
   converts a `Python` code into a&nbsp;circuit. Currently, it&nbsp;supports all basic operations, but does not support loops and
   RAM access.

As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;got the third place in&nbsp;the competition.

We&nbsp;are planning to&nbsp;make our code open source as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the 
[`Cirbo`](https://github.com/spbsat/cirbo) package.
